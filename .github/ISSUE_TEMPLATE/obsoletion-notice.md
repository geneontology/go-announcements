Dear all, 

The proposal has been made to obsolete [GO ID: term label]. 
(keep one, remove others): 

* The reason for obsoletion is that the term is not clearly defined and usage has been inconsistent

*  The reason for obsoletion is that this term represents a GO-CAM model.
*  The reason for obsoletion is that this term represent an assay and not a real GO process. 
* The reason for obsoletion is that this represents a phenotype.
*  The reason for obsoletion is that the data from the paper for which the term was requested can be accurately described using [appropriate GO term] 
* The reason for obsoletion is that this term represents a gene product.
* The reason for obsoletion is that this term refers to a class of proteins.
*  The reason for obsoletion is that this term was added in error.
* The reason for obsoletion is that more specific terms were created.
